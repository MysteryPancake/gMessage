This project of mine was created with the intention of creating a functional replication of [iMessage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMessage) for Garry's Mod.

Currently, it's a heavy work in progress, and this repository is simply being used to store files that I might end up losing later. Note that once this project is complete, I'll publish it to the [Garry's Mod workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=4000) and publish all the code used in the addon to this repository.

Please note that I am not affiliated or sponsored by Apple in any way, and that I just wanted to create this for fun (please don't sue me Apple).
